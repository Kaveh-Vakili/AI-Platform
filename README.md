## What is STRATOS AI?

STRATOS AI is a full-stack platform where users upload business documents, ask grounded questions, and run reusable governed agent workflows that produce executive-ready briefings with citations, audit trails, token/cost accounting, and a hallucination-risk verdict on every output.

**Who it is for:** consultants, analysts, founders, investors, and ops teams who need defensible, source-grounded AI output from their own documents — and who care *how* the AI reached its conclusion, not just what it said.

**Why it is more than a RAG chatbot:** A basic RAG app answers a question. STRATOS treats generation as a governed industrial process with typed agents, declarative workflow templates, per-run cost accounting, and hallucination risk scoring baked into the pipeline.

## What is Built (Current State)

### Phase 1 — Foundation & Auth ✅
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL database
- Full SQLAlchemy schema (15 tables) including token_usage_logs and hallucination_checks
- JWT authentication: register, login, get current user
- Docker-based Postgres + pgvector setup

### Phase 2 — Document Pipeline ✅
- Workspace management (create, list)
- PDF upload with local file storage
- Automatic PDF parsing with pypdf
- Token-aware chunking (400 token chunks, 50 token overlap) with tiktoken
- Document status tracking: uploaded → parsing → ready

### Phase 3 — RAG Pipeline ✅
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small embeddings (1536 dimensions)
- pgvector storage with IVFFlat cosine similarity index
- Semantic retrieval: embed query → find top-k similar chunks
- Grounded chat endpoint: Claude Haiku answers questions using only retrieved chunks
- Every claim tagged with source chunk ID
- Token usage tracked per request

### Phase 4 — Agent Harness (Logic Layer) ✅
- BaseAgent abstract class with shared RunContext
- AgentRegistry: typed agent registration and lookup
- WorkflowEngine: declarative template execution with persisted state
- Human approval checkpoints (pause/resume)
- Halt-on-error with partial artifact retention
- Three workflow templates: Executive Briefing, Risk Review, Investor Memo
- Three agents implemented: DocumentResearch, ExecutiveBriefing, TokenHallucinationControl
- Token ledger: running cost total across all LLM calls in a run
- Hallucination checker: claim-to-source alignment scoring (0-1)
- 9 passing tests with FakeLLM and FakeRepo (no DB or network needed)

---

## Agent Harness

The harness turns a declarative workflow template into an executed, logged run.

- **Agents** are Python classes subclassing `BaseAgent`, registered by `agent_type`
- **Workflow templates** are data (JSON), not code — new workflows need no redeploy
- **RunContext** is a shared mutable object threaded between agents — agents never call each other directly
- **Every LLM call** goes through `BaseAgent.llm()` so token usage is always captured
- **State is persisted** after every step — runs are resumable from the database alone
- **Approval gates** pause a run at `awaiting_approval` until a user POSTs approve/reject

---

## Token & Hallucination Monitoring

Two dedicated database tables capture governance data on every run:

**token_usage_logs** — one row per LLM call
- Tracks prompt tokens, completion tokens, estimated cost per model
- Aggregated per run for cost summary dashboard

**hallucination_checks** — one row per output review
- Source alignment score (0-1): how well claims match retrieved chunks
- Risk level: low / medium / high
- Unsupported claims: list of claims with no matching source
- Missing citations: supported claims that lack inline citation tags
- Recommended rewrite: safer version grounded only in available sources

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop
- OpenAI API key
- Anthropic API key

### 1. Clone and enter the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kaveh-Vakili/AI-Platform.git
cd AI-Platform
```

### 2. Start the database
```bash
docker run --name stratos-db \\
  -e POSTGRES_USER=stratos \\
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=stratos \\
  -e POSTGRES_DB=stratos \\
  -p 5432:5432 -d pgvector/pgvector:pg16
```

### 3. Set up the backend
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 4. Create your .env file


DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://stratos:stratos@localhost:5432/stratos
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key


### 5. Start the server
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 6. Run the tests
```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

All 9 tests pass with no database or API keys required.

### 7. Enable pgvector
```bash
docker exec -it stratos-db psql -U stratos -d stratos -c "
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
ALTER TABLE document_chunks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS embedding vector(1536);
"
```
